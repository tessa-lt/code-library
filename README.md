Front-end code library for programmers
============

Copy-and-paste-able HTML/CSS/JS for creating simple web interfaces with minimal specialized markup. Created for my former co-workers to stop them from reverting to table layouts and inline styles following my departure. 

Browser Compatibility

- **Full support:** modern webkit, Firefox, IE9+ (not yet tested in Firefox 3)
- **Good enough support:** IE8 will render all layouts properly, but will be missing CSS3 gradients, box-shadows, and border-radii
- **Not so great support:**IE7 will not render layout or horizontal form elements correctly. Tabbed navigation will be usable, but current tab will have a bottom border.
